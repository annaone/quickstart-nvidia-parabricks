# quickstart-nvidia-parabricks
## Parabricks on the AWS Cloud


This Quick Start deploys the germline pipeline for whole genome analysis using Parabricks, an accelerated genomics analysis framework developed by NVIDIA, on the AWS Cloud in about 15 minutes.

Power faster, more accurate genomic analysis with NVIDIA Clara™ Parabricks®. A GPU-accelerated computational genomics application framework, it delivers accurate and accelerated analysis of next-generation sequencing (NGS) data for researchers, clinical teams, medical centers and sequencing centers for cancer sequencing projects, population studies, RNA-Seq, and many more applications.

The Quick Start builds an AWS environment that spans two Availability Zones for high availability, and provisions an AWS Batch compute environment for On-Demand Instances. These environments include Parabricks g4dn instances include GPUs for hardware acceleration.

The Quick Start offers two deployment options:

- Deploying Parabricks into a new virtual private cloud (VPC) on AWS
- Deploying Parabricks into an existing VPC on AWS

You can also use the AWS CloudFormation templates as a starting point for your own implementation.
